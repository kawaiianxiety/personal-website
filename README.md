# personal-website

ðŸŒ¸Hi! I've finished my first website. It's my graduate project and personal site all rolled into one. You can read these code and give a feedback. I say more: I **need** a feedback because I want to become a template designer!

So, this site consists five blocks: hero block (or intro), about me, my education, works and projects and contacts and social links. To imagine a website design I used Figma.

Firstly I wrote a code in Sublime Text, but lately I've received a WebStorm lisence. It's very cool!

When I created this website, I've learned flexbox, BEM metodology, managing JavaScript frameworks and Git of course. The most difficult thing for me was subdirection and legacy in CSS.

Enjoy!
